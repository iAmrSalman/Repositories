## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 11.0+

## Installation

Install CocoaPods first if you don't have it already (more about CocoaPods [here](https://cocoapods.org)):

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```
> CocoaPods 1.4.0+ is required to build dependencies.

If you have CocoaPods already don't forget to update local repo by running this command:

```bash
$ pod repo update
```

To clone *Repositories* the first time, simply run the command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/iAmrSalman/Repositories.git
```
Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
